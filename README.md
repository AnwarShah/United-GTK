## Description
Based on Flat-Plat and a Ubuntu 18.04 design concept. There will most likely be bugs since this is much bigger than my last fun-project.
Made on and for GNOME 3.24 (Ubuntu), tested and works fine on 3.22 (Fedora). Most likely will work with 3.20 and up. Since the original Theme has changed to something I don't like, I'm trying to maintain the old theme.
